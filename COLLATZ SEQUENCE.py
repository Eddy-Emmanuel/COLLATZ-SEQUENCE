def collatz_sequence(n):
    """
    The Collatz sequence, also called the 3n + 1 
    problem, is the simplest impossible math 
    problem. (But donâ€™t worry, the program 
    itself is easy enough for beginners.) From a 
    starting number, n, follow three rules to get the next 
    number in the sequence:
    1. If n is even, the next number n is n // 2.
    2. If n is odd, the next number n is n * 3 + 1.
    3. If n is 1, stop. Otherwise, repeat.
    It is generally thought, but so far not mathematically proven, that 
    every starting number eventually terminates at 1. More information 
    about the Collatz sequence can be found at https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/
    Collatz_conjecture.
